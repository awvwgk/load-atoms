    Amorphous, 2D graphene structures generated using a Monte Carlo bond-switching algorithm,
    as described in Figure 3 of the paper: `Exploring the Configurational Space of Amorphous Graphene with Machine-Learned Atomic Energies <https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2022/sc/d2sc04326b>`_.
    Files are downloaded from `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org/records/7221166>`_ and processed using
    a `custom script <https://github.com/jla-gardner/load-atoms/blob/main/src/load_atoms/database/processing/AC-2D-22.py>`_ to extract the structures and information.
