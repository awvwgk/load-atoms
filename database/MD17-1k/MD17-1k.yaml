description: |
    1k of randomly sampled training structures for each system from the MD17 dataset (together
    with 100 val and 100 test structures).
    Exact code used to generate these structures is available 
    `here <https://github.com/jla-gardner/load-atoms/blob/main/database/MD17-1k/process.py>`_.
