description: |
    1k of randomly sampled training structures for each system from the MD17 dataset
    (further split into 950 train and 50 validation), together with a further
    1k test structures.
    Exact code used to generate these structures is available 
    `here <https://github.com/jla-gardner/load-atoms/blob/main/database/MD17-1k/process.py>`_.
    Labels have been converted from the original units of kcal/mol to eV.
