MD17-1k
=======

1k of randomly sampled training structures for each system from the MD17 dataset (together
with 100 val and 100 test structures).
Exact code used to generate these structures is available 
`here <https://github.com/jla-gardner/load-atoms/blob/main/database/MD17-1k/process.py>`_.

    >>> from load_atoms import dataset
    >>> dataset("MD17-1k")
    MD17-1k:
        structures: 9,600
        atoms: 134,400
        species:
            H: 44.64%
            C: 42.86%
            O: 10.71%
            N: 1.79%
        properties:
            per atom: (forces)
            per structure: (split, system, energy)
