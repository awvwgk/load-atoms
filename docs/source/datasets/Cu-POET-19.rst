        A dataset of copper structures, with DFT labels, originally used for training symbolic
        interatomic potentials, using the `POET framework <https://gitlab.com/muellergroup/poet>`_.
        Also included are a selection of low index surfaces for testing. 
        The script used for converting the `original files <https://gitlab.com/muellergroup/poet/-/tree/master/examples/Cu-POET-19>`_ 
        to the :code:`extxyz` is available `here <https://github.com/jla-gardner/load-atoms/blob/main/database/Cu-POET-19/script.py>`_.
