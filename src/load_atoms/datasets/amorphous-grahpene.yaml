    Forces and energies were calculated using CASTEP with the following parameters:
      task        singlepoint       ! The TASK keyword instructs CASTEP what to do
      xc_functional   LDA           ! Which exchange-correlation functional to use.
      cut_off_energy 650 eV        ! Choose high cut-off COARSE/MEDIUM/FINE/PRECISE
      fix_occupancy   false          ! Treat the system as an insulator
      opt_strategy    speed         ! Choose algorithms for best speed at expense of memory.
      num_dump_cycles 0             ! Don't write unwanted ".wvfn" files.
      max_scf_cycles  500            ! Max number of SCF cycles before failing
      elec_energy_tol 1e-8 eV
      smearing_scheme Gaussian
      smearing_width 0.1 eV
      WRITE_CHECKPOINT : MINIMAL
